**Created**: 2024-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add unit tests for the Quality & Recovery Suite scripts"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Unit tests for Quality & Recovery Suite
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers, CI/CD systems
   ‚Üí Actions: Test script behavior, validate outputs, check error handling
   ‚Üí Data: Test fixtures, mock data, expected outputs
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must test all 5 scripts, both Bash and PowerShell
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Testing framework preference clarified in implementation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear test scenarios for each script
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements focused on test coverage
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Test suites, test cases, fixtures
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Specification complete
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on Spec Kit, I want comprehensive unit tests for the Quality & Recovery Suite scripts so that I can confidently make changes, catch regressions early, and ensure the scripts behave correctly across different environments and edge cases.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the collect-debug-context script, **When** tests are run, **Then** all script functions are verified to produce correct JSON output with expected status and message fields
2. **Given** the apply-align script with a valid issue ID, **When** tests are run, **Then** the script correctly parses the ID and returns appropriate success or error responses
3. **Given** the rollback-feature script, **When** tests simulate git operations, **Then** the script correctly identifies safe vs unsafe rollback scenarios
4. **Given** the run-diagnose script with various spec.md states, **When** tests are run, **Then** the script correctly identifies blocking issues like unresolved markers
5. **Given** the sync-tasks script with partial task completion, **When** tests are run, **Then** the script accurately detects the failure point and suggests correct continuation options
6. **Given** any script receiving invalid inputs, **When** tests are run, **Then** error handling produces clear, actionable error messages
7. **Given** the test suite, **When** run in CI/CD, **Then** all tests pass and provide coverage metrics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when scripts receive malformed JSON or missing parameters?
- How do tests verify cross-platform compatibility between Bash and PowerShell?
- What happens when file system operations fail (permissions, missing directories)?
- How are git command failures handled in rollback tests?
- What happens when spec files are corrupted or have unexpected formats?
- How do tests handle concurrent execution scenarios?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Test suite MUST provide unit tests for all 5 Bash scripts (collect-debug-context, apply-align, rollback-feature, run-diagnose, sync-tasks)
- **FR-002**: Test suite MUST provide unit tests for all 5 PowerShell scripts with equivalent coverage to Bash tests
- **FR-003**: Tests MUST verify correct JSON output format for all scripts that produce JSON responses
- **FR-004**: Tests MUST verify error handling for invalid inputs (missing parameters, malformed data, etc.)
- **FR-005**: Tests MUST verify file system operations (reading specs, writing reports, checking file existence)
- **FR-006**: Tests MUST verify git operations for rollback-feature script (safe vs unsafe rollback detection)
- **FR-007**: Tests MUST verify spec file parsing for run-diagnose script (detecting [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers, incomplete sections)
- **FR-008**: Tests MUST verify tasks.md parsing for sync-tasks script (comparing task status with filesystem state)
- **FR-009**: Tests MUST use test fixtures and mock data to simulate various project states
- **FR-010**: Tests MUST be runnable in isolation without requiring actual project changes
- **FR-011**: Test suite MUST provide code coverage metrics showing tested vs untested lines
- **FR-012**: Tests MUST run automatically in CI/CD pipeline before merging changes
- **FR-013**: Tests MUST execute in under 30 seconds total to maintain fast feedback loops
- **FR-014**: Tests MUST verify cross-platform compatibility by running on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **FR-015**: Test suite MUST include integration tests that verify scripts work with actual Spec Kit workflow
- **FR-016**: Tests MUST verify script exit codes (0 for success, non-zero for errors)
- **FR-017**: Tests MUST verify that scripts follow set -euo pipefail best practices
- **FR-018**: Test suite MUST be maintainable and clearly document what each test verifies

### Key Entities
- **Test Suite**: Collection of all unit tests organized by script being tested
- **Test Case**: Individual test verifying specific script behavior or edge case
- **Test Fixture**: Sample data files (specs, plans, tasks, git repos) used for testing
- **Mock**: Simulated external dependencies (git commands, file operations) for isolated testing
- **Test Report**: Output showing pass/fail status, coverage metrics, and execution time
- **CI Integration**: Configuration to run tests automatically on code changes
