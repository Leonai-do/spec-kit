```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Quality & Recovery Suite for Spec Kit
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Developers using Spec Kit
   ‚Üí Actions: Debug, align, rollback, diagnose, sync
   ‚Üí Data: Reports, tasks, specs, git history
   ‚Üí Constraints: Read-only audit, safe rollback, verification required
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Report format preferences?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum rollback depth?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flows identified for each command
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí All requirements testable via command execution
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Reports, Issues, Features, Tasks
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Some clarifications needed on report formats
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Spec Kit workflow, I want a suite of tools to debug project issues, align fixes with specifications, rollback features safely, diagnose pre-flight problems, and sync interrupted tasks, so that I can maintain a resilient and reliable development process throughout the feature lifecycle.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a project with potential quality issues, **When** I run the debug command, **Then** I receive a structured report identifying deviations from specifications without any changes being made to the codebase
2. **Given** a debug report with identified issues, **When** I run the align command with a specific issue ID, **Then** the issue is automatically fixed and verification tests are run to confirm the fix
3. **Given** a recently completed feature that needs to be removed, **When** I run the rollback-feature command, **Then** the feature is safely undone using version control and I receive an impact analysis
4. **Given** a feature specification with potential blocking issues, **When** I run the diagnose command, **Then** I receive a report of problems like unresolved markers or incomplete sections that would prevent successful implementation
5. **Given** an interrupted implementation run with partial task completion, **When** I run the sync-tasks command, **Then** I can identify where the process failed and receive options to resume safely from that point

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the debug command is run on a project with no issues?
- How does the system handle an align command when verification fails after applying a fix?
- What occurs when attempting to rollback a feature that has dependencies from subsequent features?
- How does diagnose behave when run on an empty or missing specification file?
- What happens when sync-tasks is run but no tasks.md file exists?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a debug command that performs a read-only audit of the project against specifications and generates a detailed report without modifying any files
- **FR-002**: System MUST store all debug reports in a designated reports directory with timestamps
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an align command that accepts an issue identifier from a debug report and applies the recommended fix
- **FR-004**: System MUST run automated verification after applying fixes via the align command
- **FR-005**: System MUST NOT persist changes from the align command if verification fails
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a rollback-feature command that uses version control to undo the most recent feature branch changes
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide impact analysis when attempting to rollback features that are not the most recent
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a diagnose command that scans specification artifacts for blocking issues before implementation begins
- **FR-009**: System MUST identify common blocking issues including unresolved markers, incomplete sections, and missing required fields
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a sync-tasks command that analyzes task completion status against filesystem state
- **FR-011**: System MUST detect where task execution failed by comparing tasks.md entries with actual file modifications
- **FR-012**: System MUST offer safe continuation options after detecting task failure points
- **FR-013**: All commands MUST provide clear success or failure messages with actionable next steps
- **FR-014**: System MUST prevent destructive operations without explicit user confirmation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "destructive" - file deletion, git operations, both?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST log all command executions for audit purposes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Log retention policy?]

### Key Entities
- **Debug Report**: Represents the output of a quality audit, containing identified issues, their severity, location, and recommended fixes
- **Issue**: A specific deviation from specifications found during debugging, with unique identifier, description, affected files, and fix suggestions
- **Feature**: A complete unit of work tracked in version control, with associated branch, specification, implementation plan, and tasks
- **Task**: An individual work item from tasks.md, with status, description, affected files, and completion criteria
- **Diagnosis Result**: Output from pre-flight checks, containing blocking issues, warnings, and readiness assessment
