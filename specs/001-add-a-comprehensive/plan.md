# Implementation Plan: Add a Quality & Recovery Suite to Spec Kit

**Branch**: `001-add-a-comprehensive` | **Date**: 2024 | **Spec**: [specs/001-add-a-comprehensive/spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-add-a-comprehensive/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This plan outlines the technical steps to add five new slash commands (/debug, /align, /rollback-feature, /diagnose, /sync-tasks) to the Spec Kit framework. The implementation will extend the existing command template and script architecture.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Click (CLI framework), existing Spec Kit codebase  
**Storage**: File system (markdown templates and scripts)  
**Testing**: pytest (existing test framework)  
**Target Platform**: Linux/macOS/Windows (cross-platform CLI)  
**Project Type**: single (CLI tool)  
**Performance Goals**: <1s command execution  
**Constraints**: Must integrate with existing command structure  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 new commands with corresponding scripts

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

[Gates determined based on constitution file]

└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/tasks command - NOT created by /plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)
### New Command Templates
Five new template files will be created in templates/commands/:
- debug.md
- align.md
- rollback-feature.md
- diagnose.md
- sync-tasks.md

### New Backing Scripts
Ten new script files will be created (one Bash and one PowerShell for each command) in scripts/bash/ and scripts/powershell/.

### Modified Files
The following existing files will be updated:
- .github/workflows/scripts/create-release-packages.sh: To add the new command templates to the release builds.
- README.md: To add the new commands to the command reference table.
- spec-driven.md: To describe the new Quality & Recovery Suite workflow.
- CHANGELOG.md: To document the new feature.

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure. New commands follow existing pattern of template + dual scripts (bash/PowerShell).

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Review existing command implementation patterns
   - Research best practices for CLI command error handling
   - Study existing script structure for consistency

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research existing Spec Kit command patterns"
   Task: "Find best practices for CLI error handling in Click"
   Task: "Review cross-platform script compatibility requirements"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Command structure (name, template path, script paths)
   - Template format and placeholders
   - Script parameter interfaces

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Each command's CLI interface
   - Script execution contracts
   - Template rendering contracts

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Command registration tests
   - Template file existence tests
   - Script execution tests

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each command → integration test
   - Cross-platform script execution tests

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh __AGENT__`
   - Add new commands to AGENTS.md
   - Document Quality & Recovery Suite workflow

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, AGENTS.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Create 5 command template files (parallel)
- Create 10 backing script files (parallel)
- Update CLI registration in __init__.py
- Update release packaging script
- Update documentation files
- Add tests for each command

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Templates and scripts can be created in parallel [P]
- CLI registration after templates exist
- Documentation after implementation
- Tests alongside implementation

**Estimated Output**: ~15-20 tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [ ] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [ ] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [ ] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
