# Project Constitution Establishment Report

**Date:** 2026-01-05
**Time:** 16:30Z

## Initial Project State

The project `Spec Driven Vive Coding` did not have an active constitution in the `.autospec/memory/` directory. An archived version existed in `.archive_DO_NOT_READ/constitution.yaml`, but it was not being used by the `autospec` tools.

## Summary of User's Request

The user initiated the `/0-autospec-constitution` workflow to establish or update the project constitution.

**Input ARGUMENTS:** (None provided)

## Changes Made

1. **Version and Date Acquisition**:
   - `AUTOSPEC_VERSION`: `autospec dev`
   - `CREATED_DATE`: `2026-01-05T16:23:38Z`
2. **Constitution Generation**:
   - Created `.autospec/memory/constitution.yaml`.
   - Populated it with principles inferred from the project context and the archived constitution.
   - Defined 5 principles across `quality`, `process`, and `security` categories.
   - Set priorities: 2 `NON-NEGOTIABLE`, 3 `MUST`.
3. **Artifact Validation**:
   - Successfully validated the generated constitution using `autospec artifact`.
4. **Git Branching**:
   - Created new branch `task/establish-constitution-v1-0-0` to isolate changes.
